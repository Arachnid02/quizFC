"# quizFC" 
quiz.py will ask the user a 10 question quiz using a custom programmer defined function in order to eliminate the use of 10 while loops. In addition to this, quiz.py will be able to keep track of the answers for each question and will calculate a final score when the user has finished taking the entire quiz.
